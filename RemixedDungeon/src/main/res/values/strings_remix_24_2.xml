    <string name="GoldenStatue_Desc">It\'s truly hard to believe that, this magnificent statue isn\'t just another decoration, but a malicious creature waiting for an unsuspecting adventurer. At first glance you could\'ve sworn that it\'s _%s_ was just part of it\'s arm.</string>

    <string name="NecromancerNPC_Intro">Ah! It is such a rare sight! A fellow adventurer who is not just a lifeless corpse. Hardly believable! Oh... I beg my pardon, sometimes I get too excited. You see, I myself, am a necromancer. And even though, studying the dead and death itself is what I do for a living, seeing same things over and over again, eventually gets extremely exhausting. On the other hand that\'s exactly why I am here. According to my calculations, in just a couple of weeks, somewhere in this very dungeon, something spectacular is going to happen. The _Necropolis_, an ancient city of the dead is going to open it\'s doors. And... I can\'t really say to much, I wasted enough time as it is. I need to get ready, _come back later_.</string>
    <string name="NecromancerNPC_Message1">So little time, so little time...</string>
    <string name="NecromancerNPC_Message2">I must be ready.</string>
